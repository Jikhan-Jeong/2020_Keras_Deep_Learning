# 2020_keras_deep_learning
not tf2.keras for text, functional api.

* Deep Learning with Python (Keras version without TF.2) : https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
* Keras is now with TF.2
* Keras is the easist way with Sequential for DL application, but functional API is less flexible in my view compared to Pytorch.
* Do Keras is good for the beginner and applied ML
* Do keras and torch may good for the researcher
* Personally, recommend for keras in TF.2. because keras will not be update itself, but with TF.2
* This partidition is only used for recap. (I am already done before)
